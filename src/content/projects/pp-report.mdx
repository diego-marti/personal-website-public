Together with my good friend Paul, I distilled [my bachelor's thesis](/projects/bachelor-thesis) into a paper format. We generated additional training data, reimplemented the prediction backbone in TensorFlow, improved the architecture by adding convolutional layers, scaled up the parameter count, and trained on GPUs. Yes, the previous version was trained on the CPU of a 2017 Windows laptop using Matlab... 

We never submitted this paper anywhere.
