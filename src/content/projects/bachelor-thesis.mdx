This is my bachelor's thesis. I had already developed an interest in embodied intelligence during my undergraduate studies, and this project was my first touchpoint with the concept of a world model. Building on existing work on stochastic MPC for autonomous driving, I explored different RNN-based prediction backbones to model surrounding traffic. 

I received the 2022 Walter Gademann Award for this work, which was given to the best bachelor's thesis out of the 581 students who graduated that year.
