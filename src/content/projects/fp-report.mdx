This is an ungraded report that I had to hand in at TU Munich to prove that I was doing research during my stay at MIT. At that time, I was working on the early versions of Diffusion Forcing. To keep progress secret, I just wrote a high-level critique of some of the related work. At that time, we were looking at time series forecasting as a potential application of Diffusion Forcing.
