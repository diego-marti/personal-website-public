This is my master's thesis, in which I discuss a generative 3D model that I created during my time at Yellow 3D. Unfortunately, this public version is much simplified to protect the original IP. Several tricks are not presented, including those used to localize the edits, enable different input modalities, speed up the rendering pipeline, and improve gradient quality.
